create external table speedlimit (speedlimit int, latitudeStart double, longitudeStart double, latitudeEnd double,

Query to merge weather and speed traffic datasets.
We merged on the date field to match on year,month,day and hour (e.g. yyyyMMddHH):

SELECT merged1.*, weather.speed, weather.visibility, weather.temp, weather.pcp
FROM trafficspeed
JOIN weather ON (CAST(trafficspeed.observationtime/100 AS bigint) = CAST(weather.observationdate/100 AS bigint));

Then used this command to save the file on HDFS:
insert overwrite directory '/user/ry856/merged/' row format delimited fields terminated by ',' select trafficspeed.*, weather.speed, weather.visibility, weather.temp, weather.pcp from trafficspeed JOIN weather ON (CAST(trafficspeed.observationtime/100 AS bigint) = CAST(weather.observationdate/100 AS bigint));



This was the command to create the table in Hive:
create external table merged1 (id int, speed double, travelTime double, observationTime bigint, latitudeStart double,
longitudeStart double, latitudeEnd double, longitudeEnd double, borough string, address string, windspeed double, visibility double,
temp double, pcp double)
row format delimited fields terminated by ','
location '/user/ry856/merged';
